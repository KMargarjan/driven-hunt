# Escalations

For the Director and Karen. The Builder (or any agent) writes here and stops when:
- the same item has failed 3 review rounds
- it believes the Reviewer or Architect is factually wrong
- a design, feel or scope decision is needed
- **a human action is needed** (Rojo **Connect**, the Studio MCP toggle, Studio not in Edit mode,
  anything only Karen can click). Head that entry **`NEEDS KAREN`** and list the exact clicks.

Newest first. The Director or Karen answers under each entry, and the entry is closed with a date.

## 2026-09-24 · CLOSED 2026-09-24 · Audit-002 must-fix items are outside Task 10's scope

**Raised by:** Builder, at loop step 6 of Task 10 (branch `task-10-lint-test-globals`, head
`24fd22a` + the audit commit).

**Situation.** Task 10 (audit-001 L5) passed review in 2 rounds (`REVIEW_RESULT.md`: PASS on round 2).
The one-per-task Architect audit (`docs/architecture/audit-002.md`) returned 5 must-fix items
(`ARCH_RESULT.md`). I checked the evidence for each and believe all 5 are **valid**, but **none is in
Task 10's change**:

| # | Must-fix (audit-002) | Where it belongs | Decision needed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Typed property values (Vector3, CFrame, Color3…) fail as "cannot compare", so no positioned geometry can come from disk | harness (`tools/studio_mcp.py`), before the first grey-box geometry | **Yes, partly design.** Either support typed values in the harness, or decide that geometry lives elsewhere (Workspace built in Studio; templates as `.model.json` with typed values). The Architect owns the structure; this probably needs `tools/architect.sh design geometry-on-disk` first |
| 2 | The unmanaged scan checks only scripts, so a Studio-made non-script instance in a Rojo-owned container passes, then vanishes at the next Connect | harness | No: Builder work |
| 3 | `tools/agents.py` (the four-agent gate) has no research note (rules 1, 2, 9) | Task 9 | No: Builder work |
| 4 | The Architect audits blind: earlier audits are not on this branch (audit-001 is only on PR #2) and are not in its evidence | Task 9 (`tools/agents.py` evidence), and PR #2's merge order | No: Builder work, plus merge order |
| 5 | `ARCH_RESULT.md`/`REVIEW_RESULT.md` got a Builder-written `NONE` placeholder, although only the scripts may write them; nothing ties a verdict to the merged commit; a dirty-tree audit writes an unqualified verdict | Task 9 | No: Builder work |

**The conflict.** CLAUDE.md's loop says "must-fix → fix, back to 4". Rule 4 says "one task per round, nothing
extra", and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md warns that big multi-item rounds hid failures. Folding 5 unrelated fixes
into Task 10 would make it a multi-item round about the harness and the workflow, not about L5. Choosing
between those two rules is a scope decision, so it is the Director's.

**Builder's proposal.**
- Close Task 10 as done (its own change passed review).
- Queue audit-002 must-fix items as five separate small tasks, 11–15 in `TASKS.md`, each through the full
  loop, **all before any game code**. Suggested order: 5, 4, 3 (they fix the workflow itself), then
  2, then 1 (after an Architect design for geometry on disk).
- Merge order suggestion: PR #2 (audit-001) early, so every later branch has `docs/architecture/`.

**Needs:** a Director decision (and Karen, if item 1's geometry question touches how she wants to
build the map).

### DIRECTOR's answer · 2026-09-24

Accepted as proposed, with one task added in front. Task 10 is **closed as done**: its own change
passed review. The five must-fix items become their own tasks, each through the full loop, all before
any game code, in this order (see `TASKS.md`):

| # | Task |
|---|---|
| 11 | Review Task 9 itself through the loop, and fix the findings |
| 12 | audit-002 #5: only the scripts write the verdict files; each verdict is tied to a commit; a dirty-tree audit verdict is marked as such |
| 13 | audit-002 #4: the Architect sees earlier audits |
| 14 | audit-002 #3: research note for `tools/agents.py` |
| 15 | audit-002 #2: detect Studio-made **non-script** instances in Rojo-owned containers |
| 16 | audit-002 #1: typed property values. **BLOCKED** on Karen's map decision (build the map in Studio, or everything on disk). Architect design first |

**Standing decision for every future audit.** A must-fix item **outside** the current task's change is
queued as its own task in `TASKS.md` and listed in the Builder's report. It is not an escalation, and it
is not fixed in the current task. Must-fix items **inside** the change are fixed as the loop says.

**Closed** 2026-09-24 by the Director. No open escalations remain.

#### Task 11's dispatch, verbatim (transcribed by the Builder, 2026-09-24)

The Director dispatched Task 11 in the same message, outside the repo. Its scope is more than
"review Task 9", so it is recorded here rather than inferred from a Builder-written `TASKS.md` row
(review round 1, finding 3):

> TASK 11: Task 9 (the four-agent workflow, PR #4) never went through the loop itself. Do that now.
> 1. Work on branch task-9-agent-workflow (PR #4). First merge origin/main into it (a merge, not a
>    rebase; no force pushes) so it is current with main.
> 2. Also in this task, update CLAUDE.md to the new policy: the Director (agent) retargets and merges
>    PRs after Reviewer PASS on the PR head, green CI and a clean-tree harness PASS naming that
>    commit; Karen no longer merges; the Builder still never merges. Update the KAREN and DIRECTOR
>    rows and the git-workflow section to match. Also add the stop case "a human action is needed
>    (Rojo Connect, Studio MCP toggle, anything only Karen can click)": write it in ESCALATE.md headed
>    "NEEDS KAREN" with the exact clicks, then stop.
> 3. Run the loop on the whole Task 9 change (git diff origin/main...HEAD) plus the edits above:
>    REVIEW_REQUEST.md, tools/review.sh, fix, repeat until PASS. Then one Architect audit; handle its
>    items per the standing decision above.
> 4. Push task-9-agent-workflow. Then merge task-9-agent-workflow into task-10-lint-test-globals
>    (merge, no rebase) and push, so PR #5 stays current. Put the ESCALATE.md answer and TASKS.md rows
>    on whichever branch lands first (task-9), not only on task-10.
> 5. If Studio is not in Edit mode, Rojo is not connected, or the MCP server is off, and you cannot
>    fix it yourself: NEEDS KAREN entry, stop.

**Builder's note on item 2.** "Reviewer PASS on the PR head" as written cannot hold: loop steps 5 and
6 commit `REVIEW_RESULT.md`, `ARCH_RESULT.md` and the audit document *after* the reviewed commit, so
the head always moves past it (review round 1, finding 1). The gate in `CLAUDE.md` git-workflow step 4
therefore names the **code commit** and bounds what may follow it (paperwork only). Same intent,
satisfiable. Flagged to the Director in the Task 11 report.
